`example_gni_project <https://github.com/MarkusLohmayer/example_gni_project>`_
is a  pure Python library for
solving initial value problems
stated as
first-order ordinary differential equations (i.e. a vector field on the state space)
together with an initial condition (i.e. a point of the state space).
A subset of the implemented methods is :ref:`symplectic <symplectic>`
and hence particularly fitting for
:ref:`initial value problems with Hamiltonian structure <hamiltonian_ivp>`.

The library was used as part of the Geometric Numerical Integration course
offered by the `Institute of Applied Dynamics <https://www.ltd.tf.fau.de/>`_
in the summer semester of 2021.
For this purpose, the students received the library
with the contents of the file `example_gni_project/integrators.py` largely missing.
The students' task was
to implement a number of integration methods
and to study their behavior.
